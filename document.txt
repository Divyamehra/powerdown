To run evs.py and evsavvg.py

1. Install pip:  sudo apt-get install python-pip
2. Run command python evs.py
# this will show both the instantaneous energy consumption 
value (at time t) uptil now in Watt-hours as well as the cumulative energy consumed at time t-10 minutes.
So we need to find the energy consumed in the last 10 minutes which is a differnce of these values
3. Run command python evsavg.py
# gives the avg values which have to be determined(benchmark)

To run controllingLed.py

You would require a connected RPi and leds and rgbs. A demo of the same would be shown.
